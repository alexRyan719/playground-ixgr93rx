//Hello World
    
  The first program most people learn for a coding language is the Hello World program. This demonstrates an important concept that is useful in debugging, 
  communicating with other users of your code, and self notes. By self notes, I mean both psuedocode for the rough draft of code and notes made during the coding 
  process.

    #include <iostream>

    using std::cout;
    using std::endl;
    //using namespace std;

    int main() {
        cout << "Hello, World!";
        return 0;
    }
